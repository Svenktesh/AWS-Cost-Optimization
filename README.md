# AWS-Cost-Optimization

Cost optimization in AWS involves a series of strategies and best practices aimed at reducing your cloud expenditure while maintaining or improving the performance of your applications.

## Problem statement
There are some EBS Volume and developer created multiple snapshorts . Later developer deleted the volume, EC2 instance. 
In both cases snapshorts are of no use.

### How to implement cost optimization in real time.

We used Lambda function > writen in python code(boto 3) > boto 3 will communicate with AWS API > python will communicate with AWS API > bring complete information for EBS snapshorts.

#### Explanation

Python code will connect with AWS API 
### step1. Featch all the EBS Snapshorts
### Step2. Filter out the snapshorts that stale (A snapshot is considered "stale" if it is old enough that it is no longer needed for operational purposes, backup, or recovery. )
### step3. After identify the stale we will delete the snapshorts.

##### Problem Statement Breakdown
EBS Volumes and Snapshots Context:

EBS (Elastic Block Store) volumes are used as storage devices in AWS EC2 instances.
Snapshots are point-in-time backups of these EBS volumes.
The problem arises when EBS volumes are deleted but their snapshots remain, incurring unnecessary costs.
Implementation Requirement:

The task requires the implementation of a solution that identifies and deletes these redundant snapshots to optimize costs.
Technical Implementation Steps
AWS Lambda Function
Purpose: Automate the process of identifying and deleting stale snapshots.
Implementation:
Language: Python
Library: Boto3 (AWS SDK for Python)
Detailed Steps
Fetch All EBS Snapshots

### Task: Use Boto3 to connect to the AWS API and list all EBS snapshots.

### Criteria: Define what constitutes a "stale" snapshot. This might be based on age, whether the volume it was taken from still exists, or if itâ€™s no longer needed for backups or recovery.

### Task: Use Boto3 to delete identified stale snapshots.

### Task: Integrate all steps into a Lambda handler function.

### Outcome:
By deleting snapshots that are no longer needed, you reduce storage costs associated with EBS snapshots.
Real-time Implementation: This can be scheduled to run at regular intervals (e.g., daily or weekly) using CloudWatch Events to trigger the Lambda function.
Considerations

### Permissions:
Ensure the Lambda function has the necessary IAM roles and policies to describe and delete snapshots.
Testing: Thoroughly test the Lambda function in a development environment to ensure it correctly identifies and deletes only the stale snapshots.

### Logging:
Implement logging to monitor which snapshots are being deleted, which can help in auditing and troubleshooting.
